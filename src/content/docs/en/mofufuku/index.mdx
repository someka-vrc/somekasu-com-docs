## Tool Overview

"Mofufuku" is a tool that automatically adjusts normal maps and length masks for fur shaders to generate textures that prevent hair from colliding with clothing. It adjusts the direction and length of the hair to resolve collisions with clothing.

## Use Cases

Suitable for those who have a base body fur shader material but the hair collides with clothing purchased from external stores.

## Notes

* Supports only lilToon shaders. It might work with compatible shaders or if you apply the generated textures to non-lilToon shaders, but this is not supported by the developer.  
* Requires normal maps/length masks for the base body's fur shader. Mofufuku adjusts these textures but does not generate them from scratch. For that purpose, "FurTools" by マロンの小屋 is recommended.  
* Mofufuku automates processing but may not match hand-crafted assets; please perform final adjustments manually.

## Installation
